#	Database Operations (_api/managedb)
## Overview
The user or application submits a REST call to the api and can:  
  
* add a new database with a PUT, setting permissions so that requester has read-write access  
* delete a database with a DELETE  
* read database info with a GET  
  
## 	Examples
