# Index Design Document Operations via Operational Queue (_api/migrate)
## Overview
The user or application submits a job request for a index design-document to be created or updated on a database, and supplies the design-document as the request.body (using the PUT or POST verb).  

index design documents have a "views" field within them, and are controlled via  "_index/ddocname" endpoints.  

If the job is accepted then an id will be returned.  
The queue processor will then process the job using submission time order ( a fifo queue).  
For index design documents, this is achieved by a direct PUT. There are no mechanisms available to rebuild indexes in the background, in the manner of views.

The user or job then polls the api for a result using the id returned from the accepted submission.  
Failed jobs will have status='failed' with job.info storing identified reasons.
## Index Examples
### Submissions
Example submission of a job to update/create an index. Note the syntax is the same for an existing or new index

```
curl --insecure -u northamd:p**d https://primary.ibm.com/_api/migrate/  
testindexdb100000/_index -X POST  
 -d @testindex/idx1.json  
```  
Successful reply with job id of <dbid>_<ddid>_submissiontime

```
{"rev": "1-f541d55e3519e75d56a4055e1fae8d64", "ok": true,  
 "id": "testindexdb100000_index_20180920100008280969"} 
``` 

### Deletes
Example submission of a request via api to delete an existing index (a queue job is not submitted - it is executed directly), which could be one of several in an individual design document. The type, as in 'json' is required.

```
curl --insecure -u northamd:p**d https://primary.ibm.com/_api/migrate/  
testindexdb100000/_index/_design/  
potilaanSyntymaAika/json/potilaanSyntymaAika-index -X DELETE
```  
 
Successful reply   
  
```
{"ok": true}
```

## Job Results Format
The job document is returned as json. 

* _id	
-- set as submissiontime down to microseconds  
--	cloudant unique id for document  
-- returned as id field of submission response.
* _rev	
-- cloudant revision   	
*  ddoc  	
-- the code of the designdoc which was submitted (request body)
* requester  	
-- useraccount of job submitter  	
-- extracted from cookie or from basicauth header
* status  
-- one of [submitted,processing,failed,success]  
--	marker of progress for operational queue  
--	queue only runs entries marked _submitted_  
-- updating the status to failed or canceled will drop it from the queue (no api support for this yet)
* info	
-- result of operation with name of index (since index names can be generated by cluster if not supplied in ddoc
* qtime  	
-- time of submission	
-- used to order queue, so smallest qtime goes first
* submitted  
--	submission time of job into queue (pretty format)
* updated  
--	time the entry was updated by the processor	progress marker of job in progress (pretty format)
-- equals completed at end of job
* completed  
-- time job completed or failed (pretty format)
